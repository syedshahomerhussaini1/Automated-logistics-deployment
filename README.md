🚀 Automated Logistics Deployment Pipeline
Built for: High-Availability System Monitoring

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a core logistics application environment using a CI/CD Pipeline. It automates the entire lifecycle of a service—from code commit to production-ready containerization and health validation.

🛠 Tech Stack
OS: Linux (WSL2/Ubuntu)

Runtime: Python 3.9 (Flask)

Infrastructure: Docker

Automation: GitHub Actions

Testing: Bash & Curl Health-Check Scripts

🌟 Key Engineering Features
Automated CI/CD: Every push triggers a full build-test-deploy cycle using GitHub Actions.

Infrastructure-as-Code: Used Dockerfiles to ensure environment parity between development and production.

Self-Healing Logic: Implemented post-deployment Automated Health Checks that verify system connectivity and response integrity.

Operational Troubleshooting: Managed and resolved Linux-based environment conflicts and Git identity configurations.

🚦 How it Works
Build: Docker creates a lightweight image of the Flask app.

Test: The pipeline launches a temporary container.


Verify: A Bash script uses curl with retry logic to ensure the "System is Online."
